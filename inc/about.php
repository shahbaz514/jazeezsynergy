                    Jazeez Synergy was born out of a passion for amazing foods and food ingredients. It evolved from a one-woman catering business until it was incorporated as a limited liability company in 1996.

                    We are a company that strives for perfection. We believe in giving our consumers the highest quality products possible as well as excellent customer service. To do that, we provide the highest quality ingredients from premier sources all over the world. We have spent more than three decades developing innovative products that make good food even better.

                    We provide spices, flavorings, and proprietary blends for foodservice distributors, manufacturers, and restaurants across the nation. We have developed five brands that are essential to the success of our customers and our company.
